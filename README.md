# Franco's Dotfiles 

Repo for my dotfiles, 99% stolen from other dotfiles.

## NeoVim

I use NeoVim because vim is not hipster enough for me and all other text editors are for peasants. 

Key plugins I use:

### Vim-Notes [vim-notes](https://github.com/xolox/vim-notes)
Easy note taking with vim.

### Where I stole stuff from
- [Mhartington's Dotfiles](https://github.com/mhartington/dotfiles)
- [Rhomeister's Dotfiles](https://github.com/rhomeister/dotfiles)
